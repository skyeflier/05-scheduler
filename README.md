# Slay the Day!

## Description

This project was created becasue I desperately needed a simple day planner, so I can pencil in work and studying to stay organized. 

This scheduler is great for a 9-5 employee looking for something minimal to write a list of to-dos and appointments. 

In this project I learned how to properly use JSON, localStorage and jquery. I also gained more confidence in my ability than I had in previous projects. This one felt manageable and like I was able to digest everything I was doing.

## Installation
Just open the link provided here: https://skyeflier.github.io/05-slay-the-day/

## Usage
Simply type your schedule in the grey, teal and gold boxes in the center, and click the dusty rose button to the right to save your schedule for each hour. Make sure to click the save button, because if you forget, you will lose the schedule you worked hard to build out!

This only works for one day at a time, so make sure to update it regularly.

And if you accomplished a To Do or something isn't relevant anymore, simply delete the text and save it again to update. 

## Features

When you input text into the middle section, and you click the save button, your content will save even if you refresh the screen!

The colors of the page change as the time of day changes. Here's the key:
Past time: grey
Current time: gold
Future time: teal
